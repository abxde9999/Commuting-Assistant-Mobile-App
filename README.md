# Biyahe: Manila Commuting-Assistant-Mobile-App

This project is about a map-based Android mobile application that aims to address people’s difficulties in commuting in the Philippines. The objective of this project is to develop a map-based commuting assistant that shows appropriate routes, origin, and destination points, and the pickup and drop-off points estimate the total fares for taking the suggested public vehicles and budgeting and gives the ability to get help from emergency contact via SMS. Biyahe: A Map-Based Manila Commuting Mobile Assistant has five major features. The system suggests origin and destination points and the kind of vehicle. It also estimates the total fare as well as the real-time proximity of the user to the pickup and/or drop-off points towards the desired destination. The application displays the origin and drop-off points on the maps and the required mode of transportation depending which point the user currently is on the journer to continuously guide the commuter on their commute. The SOS feature lets the user send their latitude and longitude as well as a custom SOS message to an emergency contact through SMS or messaging. Additionally, the system shows the user’s current location’s and can show nearby landmarks on the map and in the case that the user is lost and does not know where they are, Biyahe has the ability to determine the current address of the user based on their geolocation. Lastly, Biyahe has the function to look for nearby schools, restaurants and hospitals based on the current location of the user which shows as pins on the map that when tapped on, shows the name of the chosen establishment and its address.
